# In-Class and Example Programming Activities Repository

## Purpose

This repository contains a curated collection of **in-class programming activities and examplars** used to support active learning in introductory and intermediate computer science courses. The activities are designed to reinforce core programming concepts through guided practice, peer discussion, and instructor-facilitated problem solving.

Each activity is intentionally scoped for completion during a class session and emphasizes **conceptual understanding, code reading, debugging, and incremental design**, rather than polished or production-level software. Materials in this repository may include starter code, partially completed programs, prompts for analysis, and follow-up reflection questions.

This repository is provided **for educational use only**. All materials are intended for classroom instruction, instructional demonstration, and student learning support. Redistribution or use outside of an educational context is not permitted.

## How to Use This Repository

- Instructors may select individual activities to use during lectures, labs, or workshops.
- Students may reference activity files during class to follow along, experiment, and practice.
- Activities may be adapted or extended for homework or review, at the instructor’s discretion.

Unless otherwise stated, activities assume:
- Basic familiarity with C++ syntax
- Use of a standard C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later

## Activity Index

Each activity is organized by topic. Links below point to the associated files or folders for that activity.

### Programming Fundamentals

- **Arrays** - This C++ program demonstrates fundamental array manipulation techniques, including forward and reverse iteration through integer arrays using different loop constructs. The code also illustrates the relationship between C++ strings and character arrays, showing how both can be accessed element-by-element using index notation. This example serves as an introductory tutorial for understanding array traversal patterns and the dual nature of string data in C++.

### Strings and Characters

- **Caesar Cipher (ASCII and Wrap-Around Logic)**  - This C++ program implements a Caesar cipher encryption algorithm, a classical substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the input text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. The user provides plaintext input and a shift key (1-25), and the program encrypts the message by applying the specified shift while preserving non-alphabetic characters. This implementation demonstrates fundamental concepts in cryptography, string manipulation, and ASCII character encoding.

### Classes

- **Parking Meter Examplar** - A complete programming assignment exemplar that mirrors the BookTracker assignment in complexity but uses a completely different domain (coin-operated parking meters). Includes student-facing assignment documents, correct and intentionally buggy implementations, 11 comprehensive GoogleTests with student-friendly error messages, Codio autograder scripts, and an AI reflection discussion activity. This exemplar is production-ready and can be deployed immediately as an alternative or follow-up to the BookTracker assignment.

- **Student Organization** - A hands-on activity designed for HBCU students learning object-oriented programming for the first time. Students build a StudentOrganization class to manage campus groups like SGA and Campus Activities Board, practicing core OOP concepts through relatable scenarios including Homecoming planning, budget management, and member tracking. Includes progressive challenges, complete code solutions, and materials in both Word and Markdown formats.
