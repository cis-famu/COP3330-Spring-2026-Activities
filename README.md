# In-Class Programming Activities Repository

## Purpose

This repository contains a curated collection of **in-class programming activities** used to support active learning in introductory and intermediate computer science courses. The activities are designed to reinforce core programming concepts through guided practice, peer discussion, and instructor-facilitated problem solving.

Each activity is intentionally scoped for completion during a class session and emphasizes **conceptual understanding, code reading, debugging, and incremental design**, rather than polished or production-level software. Materials in this repository may include starter code, partially completed programs, prompts for analysis, and follow-up reflection questions.

This repository is provided **for educational use only**. All materials are intended for classroom instruction, instructional demonstration, and student learning support. Redistribution or use outside of an educational context is not permitted.

## How to Use This Repository

- Instructors may select individual activities to use during lectures, labs, or workshops.
- Students may reference activity files during class to follow along, experiment, and practice.
- Activities may be adapted or extended for homework or review, at the instructor’s discretion.

Unless otherwise stated, activities assume:
- Basic familiarity with C++ syntax
- Use of a standard C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later
